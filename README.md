# STA206Final

This repository represents the scripts and code used for generating results and models for the Stats 206 final project at UC Davis. The goal of this repository is to produce a model for predicting covid cases and deaths. 



## Raw data

- exists in the `covid-project-raw-data` folder 


## Data exploration

- conducted using the `covid_dount.Rmd` script. The file `covid_count.html` report of this analysis is included as well.


## Model exploration
- conducted using the `Covid_Data_Summary_Cases_Model.Rmd` as well as the `sum_stats_death_by_covid.Rmd` were used to explore and fit models with covid infection rate, and death rate as response variables, respectively.
- step AIC model exploration was conducted in the 
- outlier exploration and model validation as well as comparison of regsubsets to the stepAIC was addtionally conducted using `Covid_Data_Summary_Cases_Model.Rmd`. The file `Covid_Data_Summary_Cases_Model.html` report of this analysis is included as well.
